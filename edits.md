- Change the order of the sections to Education, Experience, Skills
- In employment history, in the asset protection section, use "my fellow customer host and I" instead of "myself and my fellow customer host"
- Stick to passive voice and try to quantify how much you did in each job (how many new cashiers did you train for example)

Alexandra's Feedback: 
- Definitely add an internship or academic project section
    - you have so many awesome and flashy hard skills "Python, SQL (Oracle or MySQL), R Studio, HTML/CSS) so find a way to show them off
    - since you're a senior, you've defintely had the chance to do some cool project in a group
    - you can highlight cool things you did in there to display more of the way you use your coding skills "team lead in R-based research project where we found incinsistencies in x and saved company X% of revenue" I don't know but something coding related :)
- When writing bullet points I was taught this formula:
    - strong/active verb + skill you used (that the company is looking for) + for what (result: quantifiable)
    - ie) Slashed customer theft in half by implementing efficient and minitored checkout procedure boosting revenue by 2%
    - Thats a wierd made up example but you get the point lol (slashed is a strong verb, followed by what you did, then the quantifiable results 2% increase)
    - All your points should be in this format
- Awesome start to your resume! Super impressive to see "salutatorian" and LOVE to see women in STEM :D woohoo!!
